Problem Description and Background Discussion
	The problem that I will examine is where I would place an Indian restaurant in New York. Indian food is still relatively unknown in the US (when compared to a cuisine as ubiquitous as pizza or Tex-Mex). This means there is an opportunity for growth. The report will aim to determine which NYC neighborhood would be best to open an Indian restaurant. NYC is a large, multicultural city with many kinds of cuisine, so Indian restaurants are likely more plentiful here than somewhere like Alabama. However, Indian food is still not as competitive a market space as pizza (no large chains, less competition).
